				<h3 class="text-normal">Building an Enterprise Mobility Roadmap</h3>
				<p>With any journey itâ€™s important to know your destination and the optimal route to get there. It has been estimated that the typical enterprise organization will deploy hundreds of mobile apps that connect to a myriad of data sources, offer transactional functionality, and serve content spanning from analytics to multimedia. The MicroStrategy Platform is a great foundation from which to build and deploy all of your enterprise apps, but equally important is undertaking the exercise of mapping out priorities, dependencies, resources, and integration points ahead of time and aligning that roadmap to corporate strategic goals and clear business value. In this Tech Talk, we will discuss the building of such a roadmap and invite attendees to share challenges they may be facing in getting their own Enterprise Mobility Strategy up and&nbsp;running.</p>
