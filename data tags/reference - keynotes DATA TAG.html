<h3 class="text-normal text-large">The AI Advantage: How to Put the Artificial Intelligence Revolution to&nbsp;Work</h3>
<p>Tom Davenport is one of the first observers to describe the role of artificial intelligence (AI, or also known as cognitive technologies), in mainstream business. Based on the themes in his new book, The AI Advantage (MIT Press, October 2018), he reports on what technologies are being used for what purpose and how companies can get value from them. Davenport cuts through extensive AI hype to explain how businesses can put artificial intelligence to work now, in the real world. He contrasts the excessively ambitious "moon shots" at some organizations to the use of AI to quietly and meaningfully improve core operations--even at leading edge firms like Amazon. He also contrasts what is actually happening to workforces because of AI to the overly alarming predictions about automation-driven job loss. Davenport will conclude by outlining steps to becoming a "cognitive company" that makes broad and effective use of AI, and summarizes how firms can effectively manage this powerful&nbsp;resosource.</p>

<h3 class="text-normal text-large">The Seven Deadly Sins of Data Visualization&nbsp;Design</h3>
<p>No matter what design tool you use, there are seven deadly mistakes made consistently by both expert and novice data designers. When your visualization is False, Haphazard, Textual, Questionable, Confusing, Repetitive, or Verbose it’s highly likely that the audience will ignore your design, and you can severely hurt your credibility. A well designed data visualization is easy to understand and much more likely to be remembered by the audience. This talk will explore examples of these top seven mistakes designers often make, and more importantly, offers design tips to overcome these common design&nbsp;blunders.</p>
<p>The Seven Deadly Sins of Data Visualization Design:</p>
<ul class="triangle-list red">
<li><strong>False</strong> - Accuracy  the most important aspect of a visualization</li>
<li><strong>Haphazard</strong> - Data should be well thought out with key messaging and a clear purpose</li>
<li><strong>Textual</strong> - Using text-only data provides no context for readers, and is viewed as less important</li>
<li><strong>Questionable</strong> - Give your audience a reason to trust you with data transparency</li>
<li><strong>Confusing</strong> - Learn the difference between bad complexity that confuses readers and good complexity that invites engagement</li>
<li><strong>Repetitive</strong> - Don’t use the same chart style over and over again and break out of the Big Three charts: Bar, Line and Pie</li>
<li><strong>Verbose</strong> - The first impression is everything, and too much information at first glance will turn your audience away</li>
</ul>
